## What We Do

At the Social Service Institute (SSI), our mission is to develop the capability of the social service workforce. SSI aims to offer a one-stop human capital solution for the sector by providing an ecosystem for sector professionals and Social Service Agencies to convene, share good practices and collaborate in areas of human capital development.  
  
SSI is a key division under the Human Capital and Organisation Development Group of the [National Council of Social Service (NCSS)](http://www.ncss.gov.sg/ "NCSS Homepage"), and is appointed by the [SkillsFuture Singapore](http://www.skillsfuture.sg/ "SkillsFuture Homepage") as a Continuing Education and Training (CET) centre for Social Services.

In the areas of Learning and Development, SSI offers a range of capability development initiatives , including competency-based training, professional interest groups and industry networks, as well as talks and seminars by local and international experts in varied areas related to the sector. SSI has embarked on [Education Innovation 2020](/initiatives/education-innovation-2020/) with the latest learning technologies and innovative pedagogies to develop a future-ready workforce for the sector.
