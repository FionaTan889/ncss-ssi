## Volunteers/Board Volunteers

Volunteers help fulfil the manpower needs of the social service sector by complementing the roles of full-time professionals and staff of Social Service Agencies. An effective engagement of skilled volunteers can enhance service delivery and offer long-term human capital solutions for such organisations. The Institute also offers a range of learning initiatives to improve board performance. These events are fantastic opportunities for board members from Social Service Agencies and Non Profit Organisations to network, collaborate and build relationships.
