## Post-Course Information

**<u>How are the courses evaluated?</u>**  
  
SSI, SSG or its appointed agents will be obtaining feedback from you and your supervisors (for organisation sponsored learners) at various stages of the course. As such, you will be required to give consent to allow SSI, SSG or its appointed agent to call/email/SMS you for the purpose of obtaining information related to the courses. This post-course feedback will enable us to gauge the quality of training, effectiveness of the curriculum and assess the transfer of knowledge and skills into practice at workplace.  
  
  
**<u>What type of certification will I receive?</u>**  
  
SSI will be awarding a Certificate of Achievement or Certificate of Attendance in electronic form (e-Certs) to learners who have met the attendance and assessment requirements (if applicable) for the courses undertaken by them. The e-Certs will be available for download in your NCSS e-Services account (login via SingPass) and this will allow you to retrieve your e-Certs at your convenience. You will therefore o no longer need to be concerned about the safekeeping of the hardcopy certificates from SSI. You will receive an email notification once the e-cert is ready for download.  
  
Click  [here](/images/faq/Download-eCertificate-V2-Guide.pdf){:target="_blank"}     to find out steps to retrieve your e-Cert.  
  
If you would like to have a printed copy of your e-Cert, please contact SSI at  [socialserviceinstitute@ncss.gov.sg](mailto:socialserviceinstitute@ncss.gov.sg){:target="_blank"}     within six (6) months from the date of email notification sent on the download of e-certs. The first print will be provided free of charge. Any request received after six (6) months or subsequent requests for reprints of your e-Cert will be charged at prevailing rates by SSI.  
  
**Certificate of Achievement (for Non-WSQ courses only)**  
  
As there is an assessment component for this course, grading and processing of results can only take place after course completion.  
If you pass the assessment(s) you will be awarded with a Certificate of Achievement from SSI. Please note that your Certificate will only be ready approximately four (4) to six (6) weeks from the end of the course.  
  
**Certificate of Attendance (for VCF funded courses only)**  
  
Learners will attain the Certificate of Attendance upon achieving at least 75% attendance and/ or pass the assessment for the course applied for.  
  
**Statement of Attainment (SOA) (for WSQ courses only)**  
  
There is an assessment component for this course, grading and processing of results can only take place after course completion.  
  
Learners assessed to be “Competent”will be awarded with a Statement of Attainment (SOA) from SSG in electronic form. Learners will receive a notification email/SMS from SSG when the SOA is ready. This is typically two (2) – three (3) weeks from the date of assessment of the course. Please ensure that you provide SSI with an updated email address and/or mobile number so that you are able to receive this notification. You can view/retrieve and download your SOA via SkillsConnect at  [https:\\www.skillsconnect.gov.sg](https://www.skillsconnect.gov.sg/){:target="_blank"}     using Adobe Reader (at version 10). SSI will only print the SOA upon learner’s request. The first print is not chargeable and must be collected in person or by proxy at SSI during office hours.
