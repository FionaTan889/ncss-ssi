## Resources

**<u>What are the resources available to help me in my research?</u>**  
  
Besides books and online links, you can get access to a host of tools to support your research. As part of the collaboration efforts with the National Library Board, social service professionals can now tap into the e-resources available in the National Library to help you keep abreast with the latest research developments in the social service sector. For more information, visit our  [Research Hub](https://www.ssi.sg/Resources){:target="_blank"}    page.
