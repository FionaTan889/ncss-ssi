## Board Development
Developed in partnership with the Singapore Institute of Directors (SID), the Singapore Governance for Outstanding Organisation Directors Programme (S-GOOD), provides competencies to efficiently and effectively conduct Board functions.

The programme includes eight modules which are as shown below:
1. Essentials of Non-profit Board Leadership.
2. Board Dynamics.
3. Board and Management Dynamics.
4. Talent and Volunteer Management.
5. Strategy and Board Performance.
6. Financial Management and Accountability. 
7. Fundraising, Outreach and Advocacy.

Although there are no upcoming runs of S-GOOD as of now, SSI is currently working with SID to determine the development of the next run of S-GOOD and we will keep our learners updated on this.

In addition, to the S-GOOD programme, SSI also offers courses that tackles issues and challenges faced by Non-Profit Organisations serving [Children, Youth & Families](https://www.ssi.sg/Training-(1)/Children,-Youth-and-Family){:target="_blank"}   , [Persons with Disabilities](https://www.ssi.sg/Training-(1)/Disability){:target="_blank"}   , [Persons with Mental Health Conditions](https://www.ssi.sg/Training-(1)/Mental-Health){:target="_blank"}    and [seniors](https://www.ssi.sg/Training-(1)/Eldercare){:target="_blank"}   .

### Board Development 
The Develop Board Volunteers Initiative (DBVI) is the first-of-its kind in the non-profit sector for developing board members in the Non-Profit Organisations (NPOs). <br>It is conceived by SSI to enable ongoing learning for non-profit board members to manage in the best interests of their stakeholders while using resources effectively.  The initiative provides a holistic learning roadmap for non-profit board members which integrates different learning methodologies from classroom to blended learning to suit varied learning preference at their own pace
