## Training Grants

At the Social Service Institute, we offer a host of training grants to support your skills development and professional upgrading. With various types of funding support available, you can enjoy up to 90 per cent* subsidies on your course fees for short courses and academic programmes offered by the Institute.  
  
Social Service Agencies can nominate their employees for the Leadership Development Programme (LDP), Professional Development and Management Programme (PDMP) and Sabbatical Leave Scheme (SLS).
