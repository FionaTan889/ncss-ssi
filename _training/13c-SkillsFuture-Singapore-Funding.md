## SkillsFuture Singapore Funding

### SSG Funding Principle

The Social Service Institute is a CET (Continuing Education & Training) Centre that offers Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) and non-WSQ courses at subsidised rates. Both Singaporeans and Singapore Permanent Residents (PRs) are eligible for course subsidies. Employers can also tap on absentee payroll support funding for employer-sponsored training.
