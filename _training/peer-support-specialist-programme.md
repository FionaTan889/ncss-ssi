WHAT'S THE PROGRAMME ABOUT?

The Peer Support Specialist Programme was launched in 2016 by the National Council of Social Service (NCSS), with strong support from the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) and mental health organisations.  It is Singaporeâ€™s first national training programme to prepare individuals for the role of becoming Peer Support Specialists.  The formal and structured training equips persons with mental health conditions with peer support skills so as to allow them to leverage on their lived experience to support others on their recovery journeys.
