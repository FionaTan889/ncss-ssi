## Ms Barbara D’ Cotta ,Vice Principal, Singapore School for the Deaf

As the Vice Principal for the Singapore School for the Deaf, Barbara naturally has to oversee a lot of things. However, when she 
took on that appointment, she made one small adjustment. By ensuring that she teaches a class each year, she sustains her love for 
teaching.
 
This deep-seated passion for teaching was what prompted her to join the school while awaiting her “A” Level results. Although she 
could not sign at all that time, she was nonetheless accepted into the school, thus beginning her decades of utmost dedication to 
the profession.
 
“The reason why I’ve chosen to continue teaching is so that I can touch base with both the needs of my students and teachers. In 
this way I’m able to make the necessary changes, having had the practical experience. This inevitably makes my job as a Vice 
Principal much easier.” In spite of her busy schedule, Barbara still takes time out for volunteering. She interprets for the 
Singapore Catholic Deaf Community, friends or anyone in need. Should her ex students require assistance regarding any medical, 
CPF or HDB issues, she is there for them.

To the mother of two, volunteering is about giving yourself the opportunity to be of help to others, to be there when they need 
you. When you can share your talents, skills and time with those less privileged, it creates meaning and value. Fast forward to 
this day, Barbara recently graduated with a Bachelor in Education (Special Education) with Flinders University. As the oldest 
student in her cohort, she hoped that she brought with her the passion and energy that a teacher for special needs children 
should possess.

I believe that every child has something to give. If a child is weak academically, we find out what the child is good at. We don’t give up on the child, we find other ways to help the child achieve and accomplish great things. | ![buffer](/images/stories/within_stories/right-quote-w-buffer-4-short.png)   |

Aside from reading and researching on the changes in the field of Deaf Education, the sharing by her classmates gave her an 
insight into other areas of special needs. This helps to create an all-rounded perspective of the social service sector. 
“Continuous learning goes beyond increasing knowledge. It reveals new insights, as we become more aware and open to new ideas. 
Conversely, if we keep on doing what we do, thinking that we know it all, and not improving ourselves, we fall into complacency. 
That can be dangerous and alienate those around us, especially if we’re in a leadership position.”
 
It is not just the learning that makes a leader an effective one, but also the attitude. On this year’s theme of “Learn, Unlearn 
and Relearn,” Barbara shares that leaders need to have the attitude to learn and relearn where necessary. By dedicating themselves 
to learning, it helps them to achieve a higher level of consciousness to affect people and situations.

Barbara will soon have an opportunity to learn more about special education in the local context. She is looking forward to her 
Master in Education (Special Education) offered by NIE, and at the same time hopes to mentor young teachers. With her forthcoming 
study, she is also setting the right example to her children on what lifelong learning is about.

To sum up her experience, serving in the social service sector thoroughly enhances her qualities. If one is compassionate, that 
individual then becomes more compassionate because of their purposeful work in the sector. Barbara’s greatest strength is her belief 
in a child, and this belief will hold her in good stead for the best to come yet as she continues walking the ground with them and 
for them.
