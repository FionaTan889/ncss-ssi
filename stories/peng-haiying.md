## Ms Peng Haiying, Executive Director, SUN-DAC

At a crossroad juncture in her life, Haiying’s discussion with her parents led to their support, and the opening quote, in reinforcing 
her decision to step into the social service sector. 

Her father used to be a neurosurgeon. However he wasn’t happy working in a hospital because there were so many needy people with no 
access to the healthcare facilities and services. He left the hospital and moved the entire family to open a clinic in an area where 
the needy were. Haiying recalled childhood memories going around the neighbourhood urging the residents to obtain free medical services 
at their clinic. This was what deeply lingered in her mind to be pivotal in establishing the turning point of her life.

Now, Haiying has her hands full overseeing three centres under SUN-DAC. The organisation was set up in 1990 to provide day care and 
constructive opportunities for people with intellectual disability in a Day Activity Centre setting. 

While she only joined SUN-DAC in 2015, the organisation has undergone a huge transformation since then, be it for herself, staff, clients
and their caregivers. So much so that SUN-DAC was awarded the 2017 Best Employer for Social Service Organisations by Aon Hewitt. 

“We’re very humbled to receive this Award. The Aon team came down to conduct a comprehensive interview for each and everyone of us. They 
also assessed our People practice, work flow and other components.”

My joy is being able to step into the classroom whenever I can. Looking at my clients, seeing them smile, this makes my hard work meaningful and worthwhile.<br> ![right-quote](/images/stories/within_stories/right-quote.png)   |

Haiying believes in two crucial factors for SUN-DAC to be presented the prestigious Award. The first factor is the way they treat each 
other at SUN-DAC. She values building positive relationships with her staff, to know why each of them wakes up everyday to do what they 
do, despite the difficulties along the way. They become close, like family members supporting each other on this journey to serve.

The second factor is the innovative approach that SUN-DAC engages both staff and clients. For the staff, SUN-DAC rewards them with the 
idea of the week or month. Apart from allowing them to take ownership and voice out anything they find wrong or want to improve on, it 
also spurs innovation and creativity. For their clients, an entirely different programme curriculum – a “wall-less concept” – helps to 
foster community engagement and build a network of relationships for them. “When the community and our clients are more engaged, our 
staff become more empowered, thus forming the community network and benefitting everyone.”

Recognising her potential in the social service sector, Haiying is part of SSI’s Sun Ray scheme where her leadership ability is being 
developed and honed. “Sun Ray is important is because we’re the change agents leading the change in the evolving social service sector. 
We need change so that it can fully align with needs and expectations in our sector.”

As a leader, she is all too aware of the need for change – and continuous learning. To put it simply: If we don’t make mistakes, we 
don’t learn. If we don’t learn, we don’t make mistakes. A leader needs to constantly be updated on all relevant areas, to be a role 
model to show to the rest that it is all right to make mistakes. “You fail fast, you learn fast. You pick up and do things 
differently.”

As Haiying continues to diligently start her day at 7 A.M. before her staff and clients stream in, she looks forward to their 
encouraging smiles to energise her in her drive to heal hearts and transform lives.
